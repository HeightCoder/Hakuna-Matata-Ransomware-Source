## ❓ 〢 About
Hakuna Matata is an closed-source ransomware builder formerly known as 'Chaos' and 'Yashma'.  
It encrypts every file with AES-RSA and comes with several malicious toggleable features.  
  
The binaries code has been decompiled and fixed to its original state, making it moddable.  
However, some of the optional feature checkboxes were removed because they are fake. 🙄  
  
Because of that, you no longer need to pay the author to get any kind of source. 😏
